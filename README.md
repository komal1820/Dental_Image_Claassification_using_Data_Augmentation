# Dental_Image_Classification_using_Data_Augmentation

## Overview
Dental Image Classification is crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning in dentistry. This project leverages advanced deep learning techniques, specifically CNNs, to automate the process of analyzing dental X-ray images. By training a CNN on a dataset of high-resolution dental images, the model can accurately classify various dental conditions, such as cavities, fillings, and impacted teeth.
